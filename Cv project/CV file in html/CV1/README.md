This is the content of the CV.
IT contains both 'asp' and 'html' file.
You can run index.html file to view the project in the browser without hosting the content.

The required file for html is:-
			index.html,style.css and images folder only.
 You can delete other remaining file if you are not familiar with 'asp'.
   Thus the 'README.md' file is this file where i am writing about the files right now  :-)
